Let me know if you have any trouble registering or if you are worried about being able to be at the Rayburn House Office Building at 10am on Thursday.
- ~~There will be a **fire drill at 10:30 am on Tuesday**! You are welcome to come to campus, but if you'd rather not miss 30 minutes of lecture, **you may join the global lecture remotely via the Zoom app**.~~ Download the app [here](https://www.zoom.us/). The "Zoom room" ID for every East Coast lecture is `178-107-556`. I will be taking attendance whether you choose to attend in person or remotely. Normally, you are NOT allowed to attend global lectures remotely unless you have my prior permission.
