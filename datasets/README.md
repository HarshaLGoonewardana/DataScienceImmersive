I've created a Google calendar for DC which you may access [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=generalassemb.ly_q53munmr6di7mon1b589shs00o%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York). I'll be sharing guest lectures, flex time activities, happy hours, and DC-specific exigencies there.
