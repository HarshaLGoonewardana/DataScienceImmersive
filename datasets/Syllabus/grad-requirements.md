# Graduation Requirements
As data scientists, you will be expected to have many skills developed. Employers are looking for:
- People who can demonstrate technical proficiency from defining the business problem and gathering data to building and evaluating models
- People who can confidently speak in depth about the technical choices made
- People who can competently communicate to non-technical audiences
- People who can clearly write about the work they do
- People who can recognize how their work impacts real-world decisions

It's not enough to simply develop these skills; you also have to show employers that you've mastered these skills!

At General Assembly, we'll spend the next twelve weeks working with you to develop these skills and showcase them to a variety of audiences.

## Requirements
In order to graduate, you will need to, at minimum, achieve the following:
- Satisfactorily complete all projects.
- Satisfactorily complete 80% of labs.
- Earn an average of 65% on assessments with a minimum of 60% on any assessment.
- Be tardy no more than 5 times and be absent no more than 2 times.

## Portfolio
Doing data science isn't new, but calling it "data science" is. There are very few people who have a degree in "data science" or have more than 5 years of experience as a "data scientist." This provides a unique opening for you to break into the data science field even if you don't have a background in mathematics or computing!

The best way for you to showcase what you've learned and what you can do is through a portfolio.

In order to graduate, your portfolio will consist of, at a minimum, the following:
- Three course projects, at least one of which must be your capstone project.
- Five data science-related blog posts.
- A static website hosting the above.

Course Projects: More on this below.

## Blogging
Writing blog posts is the best way to gain notoriety as a data scientist.There are even [curated lists](https://github.com/rushter/data-science-blogs) of blogging sites specifically geared toward data science. Getting started can be tough, but we'll make recommendations for what types of blog posts you should do.

## Static Site
 Creating a static website is a way to curate your brand and to host your portfolio in a visually appealing way. It conveys a sense of professionalism and experience in the tech world.

## In-Class Work
While your portfolio will be your main public-facing component, your portfolio will consist of a lot of work you'll want to take some time on. Since this class moves quickly, we want to have the opportunity to quickly evaluate your work and provide feedback to you! As such, there's some in-class work that will help you to see how you're doing, where you're excelling, and if you need to make changes. It's entirely possible that you'll include some of this into your final portfolio as well - but for graduation requirements, we look at these separately.

## Course Projects
 You'll have five projects plus a capstone project. You'll hear more about these later, but you'll complete a series of projects designed to demonstrate mastery of the entire data science "pipeline" - from data collection to exploratory data analysis to modeling to writing up and presenting results. Check out a summary of past projects [here](https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/).

## Labs
Most lessons will be followed by lab time so that you can directly put what we've just learned into practice. You'll work on problems that will connect lessons together, provide more real-world context for problems you'll see, and give you the opportunity to beef up on some of those less tangible aspects of data science like data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. This also gives us the opportunity to assess how you're doing and provide feedback to you so that you can grow as quickly as possible.

## Assessments
 We'll have short quizzes during eight Fridays (weeks 1-4, 6-9) as a way for us to gauge performance and identify areas where people are struggling and excelling. In weeks 5 and 10, we'll have longer exams that focus on "big picture" areas of data science and serve as interview preparation. We have built in retake opportunities as well.

## Attendance
 While attendance is in general important, being present throughout an immersive experience is critical for success. A standard three-credit college course equates to about 40 hours in class over a semester. The Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly is a 480-hour course, or equivalent to about twelve college classes. This doesn't take into account the nights and weekends you'll spend on coursework. In order to successfully make it through this course, being late or absent considerably affects your ability to keep up with the class.
