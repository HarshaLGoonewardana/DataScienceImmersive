# DSI-US-4-DC Week 1

## Resources:
If you'd like, Slack me with some basic resources that have helped you with Week 1 material.

## General Resources:
- [Chris Albon](https://chrisalbon.com/) has a ton of good info
- Bookmark or save these [cheatsheets](https://medium.com/ai%C2%B3-theory-practice-business/top-6-cheat-sheets-novice-machine-engineers-need-5ea43d1be3de). (I'll print off the Jupyter Notebook cheat sheet.)

### Python
- [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/). This is the simplest and best one-stop-shop for getting started with Python, in my opinion. Study the first two sections and the 'list comprehensions' lesson from the 'advanced' section.
- Jake VanderPlas' [**A Whirlwind Tour of Python**](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython)
- [Long notebook full of beginner-to-advanced Python, Numpy, and Regex tips](https://www.kaggle.com/shikhar1/numpy-python-and-regex-tutorial). Don't expect to know all of this!
- [List Comprehensions: Explained Visually](http://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/)


### Git
- Code School's [Git Tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git)

### Probability and Statistics
Here are some great visual resources:
- Brown's 'Seeing Theory' website is amazing. [Here](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/basic-probability/index.html)'s chapter one.
- [Animation](http://blog.vctr.me/posts/central-limit-theorem.html) of the Central Limit Theorem
- [Visual explanation](http://setosa.io/conditional/) of conditional probability. More relevant for Bayes week!

Probability and Statistics Cheat Sheets:

- Confused by notation? Check [this](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/symbols/Statistical_Symbols.html) out.
- VERY exhaustive [Probability and Statistics Cookbook](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tdw/files/cookbook-en.pdf)
- Slight less intimidating but still overly exhaustive [Probability Cheatsheet](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54bf3241e4b0f0d81bf7ff36/t/55e9494fe4b011aed10e48e5/1441352015658/probability_cheatsheet.pdf)

## Announcements

- We are taking a 'field trip' on Thursday to attend **International Chart Day** on Capitol Hill. You should already have registered [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/international-chart-day-panels-reception-registration-44333634093). Let me know if you have any trouble registering or if you are worried about being able to be at the Rayburn House Office Building at 10am on Thursday.

You are welcome to come to campus, but if you'd rather not miss 30 minutes of lecture, **you may join the global lecture remotely via the Zoom app**.~~ Download the app [here](https://www.zoom.us/).
